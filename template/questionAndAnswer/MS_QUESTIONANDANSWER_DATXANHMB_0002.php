                                    <p>It is the Passenger’s responsibility, for services beginning at the airport, to ensure that they locate and wait for their Greeter Representative or their Driver at the designated meeting point.</p>
                                    <p>It is the Passenger’s responsibility, should they not be able to locate their Greeter Representative or Driver at the start time and start place of a service, to call the relevant telephone number as provided by AFT, before making any alternative arrangements. Failure to do this may be treated as a “no show”.</p>
                                    <p>It is the Passenger’s responsibility to advise AFT or the Representative or Driver of any circumstance that will alter the Booked meeting time and meeting place. For example:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>If the Passenger’s flight is re-timed or cancelled before it departs</li>
                                        <li>If a progressive or rolling delay to the departure time of the Passengers flight occurs before boarding</li>
                                        <li>If the Passenger’s flight is changed to a different flight number and/or a new carrier</li>
                                        <li>If, on arrival, baggage, immigration or customs delays will cause the time taken for the Passenger to exit the airside areas and enter the landside arrivals area to exceed the normal time allowance or grace period</li>
                                        <li>If the Passenger will be early or late for a pick up or kerbside greeting beyond the permitted grace period</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>It is the Passenger’s responsibility, for car services beginning from accommodation, hotels, offices or public places to ensure that they are waiting at the designated meeting point at or before the designated pick up time.</p>
                                    <p>It is the Passenger’s responsibility, for car or meet and assist services, where they have more than one large or two medium size checked luggage, or their bags are very many, very heavy or very large, to ensure they inform AFT when they are booking so that a large enough vehicle is booked to accommodate all luggage; and/or that additional staff or porters are engaged to handle the bags.</p>
                                    <p>If the Passenger brings luggage that cannot fit in the vehicle ordered, or cannot be moved by the greeter and any booked staff or porters, then the Passenger will be liable for any additional costs incurred in transferring their luggage in a baggage van or in a larger or an additional vehicle; or moving it around and through the airport.</p>
                                    <p>It is the Passenger’s responsibility to choose and book a Service start time that allows sufficient time for the journey to take place or the check in formalities to be completed in good time.</p>
                                    <p>It is the Passenger’s responsibility, if travelling with babies infants or toddlers, to ensure that they inform us and/or bring, as well as fit, the correct child/infant seat if required for use in the booked vehicle.</p>
                                    <p>It is the Passenger’s responsibility to declare dutiable or prohibited goods to Customs Officials. Under no circumstance will AFT staff or representatives handle, push or carry any Passenger bag or belongings through the customs checks. It is the responsibility of the Passenger to carry bags through customs or to engage or order a licensed porter to do so. Porterage may not be able to be organized unless it is requested at time of booking or included in the normal service. It is the Passengers responsibility to advise relevant information about the sizes, nature and number of checked baggage items to be handled.</p>
                                    <p>THE CLIENT AND/OR PASSENGER AGREE (I) TO INDEMNIFY AFT AND ITS SERVICE PROVIDER AGAINST AND (ii) TO HOLD AFT AND SERVICE PROVIDER HARMLESS FROM ANY PENALTY, LOSS, DAMAGE, CLAIM, COST OR EXPENSE WHICH AFT OR ITS SERVICE PROVIDER MAY INCUR DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY AS A RESULT OF ANY BREECH OF THE AFOREMENTIONED REQUIREMENTS</p>

                                    <p>Price quotations and price tables may change without notice until a booking is confirmed. If a material amendment is accepted to a booked Service the amended price will use the exchange rates and tariffs subsisting at the time of change and additional charges may be payable.</p>
                                    <p>A payment processing fee of 4% or less will be added to the invoice where payment is made online with a card or PayPal account.</p>
                                    <p>The base price quoted at the time of booking will include all knowable charges for the Service that has been booked. If the Passenger directs the Greeter Representative, the Driver, or AFT to change the booked Service, or if the Service start time or Delivery time is delayed then additional charges may apply, including “out of hours” surcharges if the Service then takes place outside the Service Provider’s normal hours as a result of the change or delay.</p>
                                    <p>AFT Prices do not include foreign departure, security, port charges, parking fees, customs, immigration, agricultural, passenger-facility charges or international transportation tax.</p>

                                    <p>The amount charged by AFT will be the amount due in the currency used for the booking, which is normally USDs. AFT cannot know or influence the exchange rate and policies that are applied by the Passenger’s or Client’s bank or card merchant in determining the final charge made.</p>
                                    <p>AFT may deduct all or part of payment due from the Passenger’s or Client’s card, including extra charges incurred because of a variation to the booked Service (whether as a result of the Passenger’s request or other circumstances including delays) on receipt of the booking order and/or at any time up to three months after completion of Delivery.</p>
                                    <p>AFT may take whatever steps it reasonably believe to be necessary (i) to protect the Passenger’s or Client’s card details in AFT’s possession from misuse; and/or (ii) to protect itself and its Service Provider from any delay in receiving payment for a completed Service. Such steps may include pre-authorizing the charge and verifying the card details and the card’s available credit limit.</p>
                                    <p>If the Card Company does not authorize the transaction, the Client agrees to make immediate payment to AFT at the Client’s own cost by using a different card or payment method. The Passenger and Client agree that no payment properly payable and due to AFT from the Passenger or Client will be withheld by the Passenger or Client in respect of any claim or alleged claim by the Passenger or Client against AFT or its Service Provider howsoever arising and whether by way of set-off, counterclaim or otherwise.</p>
